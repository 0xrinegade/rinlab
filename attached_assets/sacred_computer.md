▾ACTION BAR

The action bar is a container for primary and secondary actions styled with a monospace font. Positioned at the top or bottom of an interface, it organizes elements like menu options, navigation buttons, titles, or search fields.

▾ACCORDION

Accordion components are vertically stacked, expandable panels designed for efficient use of space in monospace-driven layouts, often inspired by classic terminal interfaces. Each panel consists of a header and its corresponding content area, allowing users to toggle between a condensed summary and detailed information.

▾ACCORDION EXAMPLE

There are two visions of America a half century from now. One is of a society more divided between the haves and the have-nots, a country in which the rich live in gated communities, send their children to expensive schools, and have access to first-rate medical care. Meanwhile, the rest live in a world marked by insecurity, at best mediocre education, and in effect rationed health care―they hope and pray they don't get seriously sick. At the bottom are millions of young people alienated and without hope. I have seen that picture in many developing countries; economists have given it a name, a dual economy, two societies living side by side, but hardly knowing each other, hardly imagining what life is like for the other. Whether we will fall to the depths of some countries, where the gates grow higher and the societies split farther and farther apart, I do not know. It is, however, the nightmare towards which we are slowly marching.

▾ACTION BUTTONS

Action buttons let users perform actions. They are used for task-based options within a workflow and work well in interfaces where buttons need to stay understated.

▾ACTION LIST

Action lists are a vertical list of interactive actions or options. It displays items in a single-column format with space for icons, descriptions, side information, and other visuals. The monospace font ensures clarity and consistency.

▾ALERT BANNER

Alert banners display important messages across the user interface. It communicates system-wide issues, errors, warnings, or informational updates. Typically placed at the top of a page, it includes a clear message and may provide an action for the user. Alert Banners can be dismissed after being read, helping users stay informed about significant changes or information.

When things reach the extreme, they alternate to the opposite.

▾AVATARS

Avatars identify users or entities in the interface. It can display an image, initials, or an icon, offering a visual connection to the user. Avatars appear in headers, comments, profiles, and messages. They provide quick recognition and add a personal touch to the digital experience.

▾BADGES

Badges communicate status, notification counts, or attribute labels. Typically circular or pill-shaped, they display a number or short text, often overlaid on an icon or element. Badges highlight updates, unread messages, or categorize items with status indicators. They provide critical information at a glance, improving navigation and user engagement.

Example

▾BAR LOADER

A long loader is a visual element that signals ongoing activity or progress, reassuring users that a task is being processed. Commonly used during actions like data fetching or file uploads, it provides feedback to reduce uncertainty.

▾BLOCK LOADER

A block loader is a visual indicator that signals ongoing activity or progress while occupying only a single character of space. It reassures users that a task is being processed or that activity is occurring.

▾CARDS

Cards are MS-DOS–inspired sections designed to group related content and actions. They can serve as standalone features or function as part of a larger application. Each card clearly outlines key information, making it easier for users to identify and interact with important details.

To seek the timeless way we must first know the quality without a name. There is a central quality which is the root criterion of life and spirit in a man, a town, a building, or a wilderness. This quality is objective and precise, but it cannot be named.The structure of life I have described in buildings - the structure which I believe to be objective - is deeply and inextricably connected with the human person, and with the innermost nature of human feeling.We are searching for some kind of harmony between two intangibles: a form which we have not yet designed and a context which we cannot properly describe.

▾CHECKBOX

Checkboxes represent a binary choice, letting users toggle options on or off. Each Checkbox operates independently, allowing multiple selections without affecting others. Checkboxes are ideal for forms, surveys, or scenarios requiring multi-selection, providing a simple way for user input.

The past, though a tutor, is not a thing to lament, but a wellspring of wisdom from which we draw without regret.

A measure of obsession doth sharpen the will, for the long path, though beset with trials, leadeth ever toward glories.

Kindness and gratitude must light our way in all dealings, regardless of circumstance.

Stand firm beside thy fellow for shared triumph is the sweetest of all.

Let us strive that design be not a mere ornament to the world, but a worthy service to humanity itself.

Artifacts built with care do grant webmasters the power to shape their own fates, and to serve those thou dost cherish is an honor beyond measure.

Intensity, as fire contained, burneth most brightly when turned toward aims; thus, let us spurn the call of mediocrity and cast aside the seductions of decay.

Mistakes are not curses, but treasures wrapped in adversity, offered to those wise enough to seize their lessons.

Expect naught, but receive all with gratitude, and find a place of trust wherein thou mayest dwell for a time.

From thy master learn what thou canst, and from all others likewise, for wisdom hath many guises.

To follow with discipline is good; to follow oneself with discipline is better.

Work with fervor and take joy where it may be found, for the making is as sweet as the outcome.

Be mindful that there are ever more ways than two, and seek not merely to follow the trade but to alter its course, bringing value wherever it is given thee to do so.

Whether rewarded or not, let us ply our craft for the love of it, for therein lies mastery.

Assume nothing, and let no person escape thy regard.

A fine process doth honor the task, but let the result be no less fine.

Keep faith with those who make promises, and shouldst thou be called to push others, push thyself the harder.

Thy health is thy treasure, and building a company shall be no graceful dance, but a contest of strife.

Take always the first step, for even in failure doth wisdom grow.

Seek ever to broaden thy knowledge of art, software, music, letters, and all things ancient and new, for these are the treasures of the mind.

Thy fate lieth ever in thine own hands, and the soul readeth not only the landscape, but the heart that beats beneath it.

Let thy voice be thine own, unborrowed and unbowed, and make it heard without fear.

Rejoice in the victories of thy fellow webmasters, for in bearing witness to their triumphs is joy in its truest form.

Grow accustomed to the weight of pressure, for in such a forge is the finest steel tempered.

Thus do we press onward—undaunted and unyielding—in pursuit of a better physical and digital world.

▾DATA TABLE

Data tables are for organizing large datasets into rows and columns for clear visibility and easy interpretation. It is used in scenarios like reporting systems, dashboards, and list views where data needs comparison, analysis, or manipulation. Features like sorting, filtering, pagination, and inline editing make data handling more efficient. The entire table width is limited to 64ch to fit the grid precisely.

▾DIVIDER

A divider separates sections of content, creating clear distinctions between related groups. It is typically a line or space, oriented horizontally or vertically based on the layout. Divider helps organize information, improve readability, and enhance the interface’s clarity and structure.

Any sense of order or stability inevitably crumbles. The entire universe follows a dismal trek toward a dull state of ultimate turmoil.

To keep track of this cosmic decay, physicists employ a concept called entropy. Entropy is a measure of disorderliness, and the declaration that entropy is always on the rise — known as the second law of thermodynamics — is among nature’s most inescapable commandments.

I have long felt haunted by the universal tendency toward messiness. Order is fragile. It takes months of careful planning and artistry to craft a vase but an instant to demolish it with a soccer ball. We spend our lives struggling to make sense of a chaotic and unpredictable world, where any attempt to establish control seems only to backfire.

The second law demands that machines can never be perfectly efficient, which implies that whenever structure arises in the universe, it ultimately serves only to dissipate energy further — be it a star that eventually explodes or a living organism converting food into heat. We are, despite our best intentions, agents of entropy.

“Nothing in life is certain except death, taxes and the second law of thermodynamics,” wrote Seth Lloyd, a physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. There’s no sidestepping this directive. The growth of entropy is deeply entwined with our most basic experiences, accounting for why time runs forward and why the world appears deterministic rather than quantum mechanically uncertain.

You create the world of the dream, you bring the subject into that dream, and they fill it with their subconscious.

How could I ever acquire enough detail to make them think that its reality?

Well dreams, they feel real while we're in them, right? It's only when we wake up that we realize how things are actually strange.

Let me ask you a question, you, you never really remember the beginning of a dream do you? You always wind up right in the middle of what's going on.

I guess, yeah.

So how did we end up here?

▾MATRIX LOADER

A Matrix Loader (screen) is a visual element that simulates the iconic green, cascading code streams featured in the Matrix films. These screens often serve as dynamic backdrops, thematic treatments, or stylized representations of complex digital data. This version fits SRCL's theming and monospace font usage.

▾RADIO BUTTONS

Radio buttons are visual controls that let users make a single selection from a predefined set of mutually exclusive options. Represented as small circles that fill when selected, they are used when all options need to be visible and only one can be chosen.

You’re at the very beginning of designing your operating system. How do you choose to start?

Custom Linux Kernel Derivative: Start with a minimal Linux kernel (e.g., a stripped-down mainline LTS release), integrate essential device drivers, and build out a tailored init process.

AOSP Base: Leverage an AOSP-derived HAL and system services, using BSP integration and existing frameworks as a foundation for rapid device bring-up.

Microkernel Approach: Implement a microkernel (e.g., seL4) to strictly separate core services, relying on IPC mechanisms and user-space servers to manage drivers, file systems, and device I/O.

How will you implement your interface layer?

Native GUI Shell + EGL/Wayland: Use a lean, native toolkit with hardware-accelerated rendering (EGL), compositing via Wayland, and minimal shell protocols.

Adapted Android Framework: Employ the Android UI stack (SurfaceFlinger, View hierarchy), integrating Material Components as baseline UI elements, and build custom system apps via Jetpack.

Custom-Compositor + Custom Widgets: Implement a dedicated compositor (e.g., custom Weston derivative) and write your own widget toolkit in C++/Rust, managing input events and layouts directly.

How will you handle security and lifecycle management?

Signed Kernel/OS Updates + Verified Boot: Use a secure bootloader chain (e.g., U-Boot with verified boot), sign OTA payloads, and apply delta updates with rollback support.

TEE Integration + SELinux Policies: Embed a Trusted Execution Environment (e.g., ARM TrustZone), enforce SELinux policies system-wide, and apply monthly patch-level updates from upstream code sources.

Containerized Services + Granular Permissions: Run system services and third-party apps in containerized sandboxes (LXC, cgroups, seccomp), enforce capability-based permissions, and manage rolling updates at a container or microservice level.
